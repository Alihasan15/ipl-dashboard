Spring Batch Recap:

	1] Reader is a flatFileItemReader which takes file name in the classpath. It creates a instance of Match Input class
		for each row.
		
	2] Processor is used to manipulate the input to the output. In our case : It will pull up from matchInput instance
		and create a match instance.
		
	3] Writer is a jdbcBatchItemWriter which writes onto the hsql db. It takes match instance which is the final output 
		to be written on the db. 

	4] Steps Reads using the reader , process during the processor, 
		write using the writer.These three are spring beans.
			
	5] We defined a batch job. It contains one step which is required. Once the Job is completed it uses a job
		notification listener.
		
	6] Job Notification listener checks whether the job is completed. If completed it sends out a notification
	
	
Transient :
